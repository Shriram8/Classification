# Classification
classification:
In statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. Examples are assigning a given email to the "spam" or "non-spam" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.). Classification is an example of pattern recognition.
In the terminology of machine learning,[1] classification is considered an instance of supervised learning, i.e., learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available.
LDA:
logistic regression can be used as a classifier, as long as we can determine a resonable criterion. Prior to the widespread use of logistic regression (which requires maximum-likelihood estimation and computerized approaches), various approaches to classification were developed that use simplified models. 
 One traditional model assumes that two groups have multivariate normal distributions with equal variance. 
QDA :
One of the assumptions of LDA is that the two distributions have equal variance. If we relax this assumption, the best classification no longer has to be a line separating the space. We can get curved boundaries, or even a small region within a larger region.
